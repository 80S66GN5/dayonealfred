Day-One-Alfred-Tools
====================

At this point, this Alfred Workflow requires:

* [The Day One CLI](http://dayoneapp.com/tools/)
* Brett Terpstra's `logtodayone.rb` script, found [here](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/01/16/logging-with-day-one-geek-style/)

# What it does

* **log**: Logs to day one. This can use the time syntax outlined [here](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/01/16/logging-with-day-one-geek-style/).
* **lw**: "Log Web". This creates an entry with the frontmost webpage link and title.
* **lwc**: "Log Web Comment". Same as above but with a comment.

# To do

Eventually, I'd like to:

* Create an easy way to change the location of `logtodayone.rb` in each of the scripts
* Incorporate Terpstra's time functions
* Combine the commands for logging frontmost website with and without comments
* Add more commands. Ideas are welcome.
